# Lesson 2 - Flexing Our Muscles

As evidenced by the issues we created in our GitHub repository, there's a fair amount to be done to get this site to a point that matches Run Buddy's specifications. What they are asking us to do for them is fairly common in the world of web development and it can be very overwhelming at times, but luckily we already have our work sectioned off into these different GitHub issues so we can worry about tackling one at a time.

The first issue we are going to tackle is converting the site's overall flow and layout to enhance its design and make it more flexible. To do that we're going to use a new layout feature in CSS called "flexbox" (clever name, right?), which allows us to create layouts that used to only be achieved with heavy usage of floats and positioning. Flexbox is going to allow us to make these layout changes without having to _too_ much manipulation to what we currently have in our code. We'll be updating every section of our page in some way, take a look at some of these changes:

![Trainers mockup](assets/lesson-2/200-trainers.jpg)

Comparing these to what we currently have, you can see that we'll be working to make better use of the horizontal space on the page to provide a cleaner layout. 

We're ready to get started, but as we know, our current `staging` branch is probably not the best place to mess around. So let's get started by creating our first git feature branch.

## Make a Git "feature" branch based on an Issue



## Flexing the Header and Navigation

## Flexing the Footer

## Flexing the Hero

## One column layouts for Section Titles and "What We Do"

## Giving "What You Do" nested flexbox layouts

## Trainer Trading Cards

## 3 Column Reach Out

## Merge branch into staging
