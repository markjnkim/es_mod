# Going Mobile

We've added some really nice features and updates to the Run Buddy site so far and we're about halfway through our list of GitHub issues, but the issue we're about to tackle is possibly the most important one&mdash;making the site completely responsive to all screen sizes. The work we've completed so far has laid the ground work for us to take on this next feature request, so it won't be as you would think it is.

If we were to be building this site ten years ago we could be all done with this layout and not worry about different screen sizes, but in modern-day web development we need to make sure all layouts look good across all devices and screen sizes. This need for responsive web sites became apparent when more and more users adopted smart mobile devices like the iPhone, iPad, or any Android device, and more sites were seeing web traffic coming from those devices instead of a standard desktop web browser.

Some companies even took the time to build a completely different version of their site specifically for mobile; but maintaining one site is hard enough&mdash;let alone two&mdash;so new tools were released to help us create one site that could look good anywhere. These are the tools we'll be using to get Run Buddy looking like this at different screen sizes:



## Create a feature branch

- Make branch for setting up media queries off of `staging`

## Make current CSS more mobile-friendly

- Adjust font-size and margin/padding

## Media Query Intro

- Demo using DevTools
- Mock-ups of what we'll be building and how we want it to look at each screen size
- Set up <meta> for viewport ratio
- Demonstrate / create breakpoints for 980, 768, 575

## Apply media query rules

- Changes to all 980 first, demonstrate in devtools how they take over

- Changes to all 768

- Changes to all 575

## Merge Branch

## Reflection
