# Reach Out and Touch Faith

Having met our trainers, our visitors are now motivated and pumped to get started on their fitness journey.  In order to hit their goals, it's important to get started right away.  So how do our visitors get in touch to get in shape?  This is where the our Reach Out section will come into play.  This section is where our visitors can reach out directly to our sales staff to get their questions answered and possibly convert into a customer.  First let's take a look at the mock-up and see where this section looks like as a finished product.
