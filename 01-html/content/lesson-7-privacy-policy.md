# Second Page and Wrap-up

We've made it! At this point, we've learned enough about HTML and CSS that we can actually hold our own a bit and create simple pages for the web. There's still some more advanced techniques to learn when it comes to these two languages&mdash;which will be covered next week&mdash;but in the early days of web development this is about 75% of what a lot of developers used on a regular basis.

Throughout this project we have learned how to create and organize content for a web page, create custom styles and layouts for that content, and utilized the proper tools to protect, backup, and publish our work. This is a lot to take in, so we're going to use this last lesson to reinforce these concepts and "take the training wheels off" by building a second (simpler) page for our Run Buddy product site.

The page we're going to be building is for the site's "Privacy Policy", which has become a must-have as the web has become increasingly interactive with the user and data-centric. This is a great page to build because there isn't too much to it when we compare it to the page we just completed. As a matter of fact, it's kind of boring, but that's not a bad thing for us to practice with.

The main three points that will be introduced in this lesson are:

1. Adding a second HTML document to our web site and how they can be connected through `<a>` tags.

2. How to reuse HTML content through select copy and pasting.

3. How two HTML pages can share CSS styles, but also implement a second stylesheet for styles more specific to the second page. This will entail us overriding some previously defined styles.

For reference, this is the page 

## Creating our next HTML file

Think of this section as a shorter re-hash of the previous 6 lessons, so where did we start in our first lesson? We had to actually create the HTML file we were going to build, so let's do this again.

Using the command line, create a file in the root of our project folder called "privacy-policy.html". Think back to the first and second lessons where we created files, what was the command we used?

> HINT: When using the command line to create folders or files, it is easy to forget where you are running these commands, so don't forget to use the `pwd` command to print out the command line's current location and confirm the current directory is the one you want to use.

So now, in the root of our project's folder, there should be two HTML files: `index.html` and `privacy-policy.html`.
