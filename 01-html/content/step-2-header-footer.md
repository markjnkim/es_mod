# Step 2 - Build out our Header and Footer

## Introduction

Let us start off this section by giving ourselves a pat on the back. The hardest part of building a new HTML document is actually getting started, and we now have more than enough to work with in these upcoming steps even though there is not much (if any) visible substance to our page.

In the previous step we built a series of "containers" for our web page to hold different types of content. At first glance this may seem like a lot of extra work, but as we continue to add content and apply style to each section one at a time we'll find that this will make our lives easier. We now get to work on each section one at a time without having to worry about affecting the others.

This step will focus on building out the content and styling for both the header and footer of our page. We will formally introduce ourselves to both new HTML elements and Cascading Stylesheets, which will be referred to throughout the rest of this unit (and your careers) as `CSS`.
