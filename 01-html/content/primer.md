Introduction

Some amazing things happened in the 1990s, and we're not even talking about
Grunge music, the end of the Cold War, or the reboot of the Star Wars
franchise. After decades of quiet development and evolution, the internet
gave birth to the World Wide Web. The web set the stage for massive global
information sharing, new forms of entertainment, a new global economy, and
cat memes that altered humanity. 

It also set the stage for your future career
as a web developer, as you master some of the same technologies that made this
new online era possible: HTML, CSS, and Git. But let's go back to the past
for a moment.

The Birth of the Web
---
Prior to 1993, many people who were becoming aware of the internet dismissed it
as a mysterious place inhabited by computer hackers, academics, military
strategists, government agents, and scientists. If you were a member of this
elite cabal, you likely communicated with colleagues using a computer terminal
that ran arcane applications such as Gopher, FTP, Usenet, IRC, and email. You
navigated an ever-expanding global network of interconnected mainframes from 
the warm, cathode glow of your VT-100, deep in the bowels of an institution.

One of those institutions was in Geneva, Switzerland: CERN, Conseil Européen pour
la Recherche Nucléaire. That's French for The European Organization for Nuclear
Research, and it's where Earthlings smash particles into each other to learn
about quantum mechanics. One of those scientists was an English chap named 
Tim Berners-Lee, who was irritated by how difficult the internet was to navigate.
In 1989, he drafted a proposal to his boss for a system that would make it easy to
link any document on the internet to any other document with the click of a
mouse. His boss also hated navigating the internet and OK'd the project. Two-and-a-half years later, Tim served the first HTML document off his work computer,
and the web was born.

(Don't worry—it's only going to take you a few minutes to write your first HTML
page.)

While an astounding technical achievement and a momentous internet milestone,
the first webpage wasn't exactly eye candy. It looked like a research paper bibliography,
as did the rest of the burgeoning web until the free Mosaic web browser was
released in 1993. Its shocking innovation was to display *images inside a document*!

The Advent of CSS
---
Soon, the excitement of linked black-and-white documents grew thin and web 
developers wanted better formatting. New attributes began cluttering
HTML specifications to add color and pizzazz at the cost of more complex
code. In 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium ratified a new technology that would
separate HTML's structure from its presentation: Cascading Style Sheets, or
CSS. Webpages could now be structured with HTML and beautified with 
separate files called style sheets. Since then, CSS has evolved to become a
powerful language of its own, able to realize almost any design. You're going to
learn this language and give your HTML some style!

The Birth of Git
---
Let's turn back the clock one more time to 1991, when a Finnish computer science
student named Linus Torvalds grew weary of using terminals at institutes. He
wanted to use a state-of-the-art operating system in the comfort of his own
kitchen. He wrote a free, open-source version of the Unix kernel and released it
to the public on Usenet. Thousands of volunteers helped grow the project and
 it soon became the basis of the most popular web server operating system on the
internet. There was just one problem: Linus personally applied each
volunteer's patch to the source code that he maintained and released. He
eventually grew weary of being the bottleneck in Linux's growth, so he wrote a
free, open-source, distributed versioning system call Git. It enabled
volunteers to collaborate quickly and freely without his direct oversight. All
he had to do was approve each release. The Linux kernel continues to grow
rapidly thanks to Git, with up to seven merges per hour from thousands of collaborators around the globe. 

As a deveoper, you'll find that Git is extremely useful whether you're collaborating with a
team or working on your own projects.

Conclusion
---
Now we're ready to run headlong into the future. HTML, CSS, and Git remain the
building blocks of the web, and you're going to master them all by the end of
this course.

In the first module, you'll create an attractive landing page for Run Buddy, a
website that lets runners sign up for personal training. You'll learn all the
HTML and CSS necessary to make Run Buddy run, and look good doing it. Did you
know that your computer has a terminal emulator that works just like ones from
the 1990s? You're going to learn how to use it to organize your project and 
manage your code using Git. Finally, you're going to publish your work to the
web with GitHub. 

Join us in a toast to the past, for all the riches it provides us; and to the
future you'll help build. Welcome to the cabal!
