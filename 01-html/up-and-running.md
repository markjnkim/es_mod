# Up and Running

## Tools Used in This Module

This section contains a list of the tools you’ll use in this module. If you completed the prework, some of these will already be installed. If you have not completed the prework, please see our [guide to installing your tools](https://coding-bootcamp-fsf-prework.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/modules/chapter2/). For new tools, you don’t need to install them before you begin&mdash;you’ll do that during the lessons.

Here are the tools you’ll use in this module:

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

    * Google Chrome is the primary web browser you will use to test and debug your project as you create it.

* Chrome DevTools

    * Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. These tools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and debug problems quickly.

* The Command Line and Git

    * The command line allows you to set up your projects and interact with your computer without using a graphical interface.

    * Git is a system that allows you to create "save points" (or **commits**) of your work. It's good practice to commit your work whenever you reach a good stopping point. This creates a history of changes and allows you to revert to an earlier version if necessary.

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    * VisualStudio (VS) Code is a free text editor that runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems.    

* [GitHub](https://github.com/)

    * GitHub is a free website that hosts Git repositories. It also allows developers to code collaboratively and manages version control.

* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

    * GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.
