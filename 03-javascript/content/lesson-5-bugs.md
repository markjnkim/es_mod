# Lesson 5
## Introduction
We have made a ton of progress so far in our Battle Bots game. Now that our MVP is finished we can use the remaining time in our Game Jam to give our game some polish and shine. Since the remaining time is quite short, we should proceed in an iterative development process meaning let's finish small chunks of work rather than try to wrap our work into something too big that will be harder to finish and deliver by our deadline. Thankfully we can use Github Issues to help us focus on delivering each task.

With this in mind, a great use of time would be to share our game with other developers for testing purposes. It would be embarrassing if the game crashed as the Game Jam judges are making their final 

## One. Create a GitHub issue for each bug and feature

## Two. Create a getPlayerName() function, to handle blank/null user input

## Three. Expand attack/skip logic, to account for null/lowercase

## Four. Update shop() function to accept integer input

## Five. Randomize fight order

## Six. Save and load high score from localStorage
