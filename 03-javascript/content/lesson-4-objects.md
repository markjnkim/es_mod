# Lesson 4: Optimize the Code with Objects

## Introduction

Now that our MVP goal has been met, we could technically submit the game as-is. However, it's still not that interesting to play multiple times, because the health and damage values are always the same. We need to update our code to generate these values randomly per our next GitHub issue:

> ## WAITING ON GITHUB ISSUE SCREENSHOT

While working on the game, other game jam attendees made some great suggestions on additional features we could add. Alas, there's not enough time to implement their suggestions, but we can at least optimize the codebase now to be more scalable, making it easier to continue working on the project afterwards.

In this lesson, we'll dive deeper into JavaScript objects 

*Narrative introducing lesson project. Try to cite a GitHub issue where appropriate, and create one in GitHub to include as a screenshot.* 

*Revisit previous lesson topics that this lesson will build on or contrast with.*

*Include screenshot of what project currently looks like:*

*Tie the lesson to IRL job-skills relevancy.*


## Preview 

*A preview of the end product of the lesson.*

*Encourage student to pseudocode steps that take them from current to end product (if they have the appropriate skill level to do this).*

*- There’s more than one way to do this.* 

*- If there are more than 2 ways to go about the build, briefly discuss 2-3 different strategies the student could use, and explain why we’re going with the strategy we’ve chosen.*

*List each step w/ a summary overview (e.g., “Here’s how we’re going to approach this:”*:

- *Step 1 (e.g., Set up the HTML file for the Run Buddy landing page)*
- *Step 2*
- *Step 3*
- *Step 4*
 
*Introduce mock-up of what learner will build in this lesson (e.g., "Here's a mock-up of what we're aiming for in this lesson):*

*Transitional text to first section (e.g., "Let's get started, etc.").*

1. Create a new feature branch

2. Use the Math object to improve game values

3. Convert player and enemy data to custom objects

4. Merge feature branch

## Create Feature Branch

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include LBs as appropriate, etc.*

*Transitional text to next section.*


## Use the Math Object

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include LBs as appropriate, etc.*

*Transitional text to next section.*


## Convert Data to Objects

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include LBs as appropriate, etc.*

*Transitional text to next section.*


## Merge Branch

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include LBs as appropriate, etc.*

*Transitional text to next section.*

## Reflection

*Congratulate the learner (Great work!, Congratulations! Pat yourself on the back, etc.). Recap what they accomplished during the lesson from a bigger perspective in a couple of sentences.*

*In this lesson, you added the following skills to your tool belt, knowledge base, skillset:*

- Skill learned in 1-2 sentences

- Skill learned in 1-2 sentences

- Skill learned in 1-2 sentences

- Etc.

*If this is the last lesson in a module, recap the entire module and introduce the next module.*

*If this is not the last lesson in a module, introduce the next lesson and how it will build on the skills in this lesson.*
