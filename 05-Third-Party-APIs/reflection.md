# Reflection & Retrieval

## Reflection

As you finish up this module, take time to reflect. While journaling might not appear as immediately productive as say coding an extra feature, reflecting on what you’ve recently learned is a proven strategy for cementing new knowledge into memory. Reply to each of the prompts below to start a conversation with an instructional staff member:

* In your own words, describe what the key ideas from this module are.

* For each key idea, give an example of how that key topic is applied. 

* How do these key ideas relate to one another?

* How do these key ideas relate to what you’ve learned earlier in the course?

* What are you still curious about?
