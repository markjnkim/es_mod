## Preview 

*A preview of the end product of the lesson.*

*Encourage student to pseudocode steps that take them from current to end product (if they have the appropriate skill level to do this).*

*- There’s more than one way to do this.* 

*- If there are more than 2 ways to go about the build, briefly discuss 2-3 different strategies the student could use, and explain why we’re going with the strategy we’ve chosen.*

*List each step w/ a summary overview (e.g., “Here’s how we’re going to approach this:”*:

1. *Step 1 (e.g., Set up the HTML file for the Run Buddy landing page)*

1. *Step 2*

1. *Step 3*

1. *Step 4*

1. *Step 5*

## *Step 1 (e.g., Set Up the HTML File)*

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include callouts, images, videos, learnosities as appropriate, etc.*

> **Asset Needed:** *Image* or *Video* or *Learnosity* *For images, videos, and learnosities, use an Asset Needed callout and link to the JIRA issue. Note what type of asset it is. Make sure to add line breaks around all assets.*

> **Hint:** *This is an example of a callout. Make sure to add line breaks around all callouts.*

*Transitional text to next section.*

## *Step 2*

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include callouts, images, videos, learnosities as appropriate, etc.*

> **Asset Needed:** *Image* or *Video* or *Learnosity* *For images, videos, and learnosities, use an Asset Needed callout and link to the JIRA issue. Note what type of asset it is. Make sure to add line breaks around all assets.*

> **Hint:** *This is an example of a callout. Make sure to add line breaks around all callouts.*

*Transitional text to next section.*

### *Non-Step/Concept Section*

*Other sections can be intermingled with the Step sections as necessary. Some sections aren't a step but explain a concept instead.* 

## *Step 3*

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include callouts, images, videos, learnosities as appropriate, etc.*

> **Asset Needed:** *Image* or *Video* or *Learnosity* *For images, videos, and learnosities, use an Asset Needed callout and link to the JIRA issue. Note what type of asset it is. Make sure to add line breaks around all assets.*

> **Hint:** *This is an example of a callout. Make sure to add line breaks around all callouts.*

*Transitional text to next section.*

## *Step 4*

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include callouts, images, videos, learnosities as appropriate, etc.*

> **Asset Needed:** *Image* or *Video* or *Learnosity* *For images, videos, and learnosities, use an Asset Needed callout and link to the JIRA issue. Note what type of asset it is. Make sure to add line breaks around all assets.*

> **Hint:** *This is an example of a callout. Make sure to add line breaks around all callouts.*

*Transitional text to next section.*

## *Step 5*

ONLY in the last third of the last lesson in each module, make the last step "the Last Mile." Refer to [Last Mile Copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QGQIZU_sOBOemsSbbywDu1-gL0Z5JS2LAl-c8KY90Vs/) for example copy.* 

## Reflection

*Congratulate the learner. Recap what they accomplished during the lesson from a broad perspective in a couple of sentences.*

*In this lesson, you added the following skills to your tool belt, knowledge base, skill set:*

- *Skill learned in 1-2 sentences*

- *Skill learned in 1-2 sentences*

- *Skill learned in 1-2 sentences*

- *Etc.*

*If this is the last lesson in a module, recap the entire module and introduce the next module.*

*If this is not the last lesson in a module, introduce the next lesson and how it will build on the skills in this lesson.*
