# Module 05 Lesson Plan: Third-party APIs

## Overview 

@TODO
Two to four sentences describing what’s in this lesson and its relevance both to the preceding asynchronous content and to the upcoming challenge. Outline the 3-4  key topics that will be drawn from the asynchronous content and reinforced in this lesson for use in the upcoming challenge so that instructors understand how the pieces fit together. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

@TODO
* Explain 

* Implement

* Use

* Etc.


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes
