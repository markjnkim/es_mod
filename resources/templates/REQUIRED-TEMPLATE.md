# Module X Lesson Plan: [Title]

## Overview 

Two to four sentences describing what’s in this lesson and its relevance both to the preceding asynchronous content and to the upcoming challenge. Outline the 3-4  key topics that will be drawn from the asynchronous content and reinforced in this lesson for use in the upcoming challenge so that instructors understand how the pieces fit together. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain...
* Implement...
* Perform...


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes 
This section sets the lesson expectations for the instructor. 

* Include tips on how to have a successful class, including letting the instructors know if there is anything they need to complete ahead of class.
* Consider linking to the relevant async lessons to make it easier for instructors to review what students should/may have done before class.
* Explain the areas where students might struggle (or find easy). Make sure your instructors and your TAs understand how to assist students who require it. 
* Include instructor resources if you have any.


## Pre-Class Activity/Warm-Up 

If there is an activity that students might be starting before class or as they come into the Zoom, insert that here.

### 1. Icebreaker Activity: [Catchy Title] (10 min)
Students will have spent many hours alone this week, working through asynchronous Canvas lesson plans. Some will have been moving confidently and feeling great; others will have been struggling or feeling overwhelmed. This is a moment for students to connect with others, receive empathy and emotional support for their experiences, and get geared up for a positive class, no matter what their week was like and no matter how much of their content they have completed.

Instructors may be expected to customize these activities slightly to meet their own style and personality, but icebreakers may include:

* Small wins: Share a small victory you had this week 
* A-Ha Moments: Go around the room asking students: when did something click? What moves and work helped you move past a position of confusion?
* Just Between Friends: How would you explain what you’ve learned so far this week to your best friend.
* Childhood Dream: The instructor poses a question asking students to share their childhood dream and then relate it to what their current career aspirations are.
* Two Truths and a Lie: One or two students are asked to present two truths about themselves and a lie. The group votes (can be a poll even) which is the lie.
* Share your Struggle: Instructor explains his or her own experience learning these topics and how much work and resilience it took to succeed
* Speed Demons: Messaging that remind students how fast they are moving compared to traditional learners and reminding them that it’s ok to feel overwhelmed as long as they don’t give up.
* Inspirations: around the horn sharing of why you’re here. What/who inspires you?
* Super power: ask students to share their “super powers” or something they are really good at (coding or outside of class!) 


### 2. Instructor Do: [Challenge Intro] (5 min)
Create talking points for the instructor so that they can quickly introduce the upcoming challenge. The ideal introduction:

* Gets learners excited and confident about the challenge
* Helps learners understand how the async work will support their challenge work 
    * Provides a good mix of ‘tough love’ and ‘forgiveness’ with regards to students’ current progress on the asynchronous content
* Helps learners understand how this class will support their challenge work
* Illustrates briefly how the skills used in the challenge are relevant in industry (e.g., “The libraries you’ll be accessing in this challenge are the industry standard and are listed in many job requirements.”)
* States how the artifact students are creating in the challenge will improve their repository/portfolio

_A 120 minute lesson plan (minus ~25 minutes for intro and outro) would have 95 minutes of instruction. Create 3-5 of the following 3-part arcs to convey the relevant concepts and to address all learning objectives._ 

_A standard arc would be 5-10 minutes of Instructor Do, 10-15 minutes of Student Do, and 5 minutes of review, so each arc could be 20-30 minutes. Of course, complex concepts may demand longer time periods to convey, but try to limit “lecture time” (Instructor Do)  to 10 minutes._

### 3. Instructor Do: [Title] (5 or 10 min) 
The online Instructor Do’s should ask instructors to teach key concepts from this week’s content, assuming that students will only have completed 10-40% of offline work. Because of the shortened lesson plan format, individual  should be less than 10 minutes. should rarely surpass 10 minutes each. Remember to connect each Instructor Do to the async content as well as to the upcoming challenge. 

Every Instructor Do should include the following four critical aspects in addition to the actual content that will be delivered:
* Goal or objective for this Instructor Do. 
* Description of how this Instructor Do equips the students for the challenge and, ideally, for the real world outside of the class. 
* Ensure that the Instructor Do explicitly clarifies exactly which topic of the asynchronous content is being highlighted, where it can be found in the asynchronous work, what the core takeaway should be for learners, and how it relates to the upcoming challenge.
    * E.g., “We are going to drill down today on how to research and install relevant Python libraries and methods. This was covered in the lesson about X this week, when you installed the Y library to help complete Z part of your online work. If you need to review this concept after or during class, open up the lesson that covered X. In your upcoming challenge, you will need to research and install Python libraries in order to complete Z section of your project. This activity will ensure that we’re all really comfortable with this skill when we get to it.”
* Finally, be sure to include a clear transition to the student activity. The many instructors delivering your content will have very different levels of teaching and speaking experience, and providing clear methods to transition from Instructor Dos to Student Dos ensure that the flow of activities makes sense to the students, who will want to know exactly when to start moving from passive listening to active working.

**Visuals**: Insert code blocks & screenshots as needed throughout lesson plans. 

**Tip**: Use “Tip:” to callout special advice for the Instructor or TA.


### 4. Student Do: [Title of Activity] (10 or 15 min) 

Online Student Do’s ask students to complete a live activity while in the online class and share their results. We strongly encourage you to use the Zoom Breakout Room functionality to create pair or small group activities for at least one activity per class (students have already spent a lot of time working alone). Group activities are particularly useful to meet instructional objectives that require students to work collaboratively.

Because of the shortened time period for online live classes, try to keep set-up time, activities or additional files as simple as possible to maximize time for work. 
	
Every Student Do should include the following four elements:

1. Overview of the activity for the instructors.

2. Link to student-facing instructions (e.g., Instructions: README.md). These can be sent to students via chat or Slack during the class.

3. Directions for the instructor and TA, including what the instructors and TAs should be doing during the activity. 

    Examples: instructors and TAs should visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

4. Links to relevant files the students will need (e.g., File: Starter Code).
Hint: Use “Hint:” to tell instructors how to call out more information (or steps) to help struggling students complete an activity. 


### 5. Instructor Review: [Activity Name] (5 or 10 min) 
Instructor Reviews should bring the class back together if they were broken into Breakout rooms, and then review in one of the following ways: ask for volunteers to provide their results, have the instructor walk through the solution, ask students to lead reviews for other student work, provide prompts to ensure that students truly understood the underlying concepts, and finally provide feedback telling students what they must do to ensure they have what they need for the Challenge. 

Instructor Reviews should contain:

* Instructor commentary, facilitation questions and talking points.
* Solutions and explanations to the activity that are comprehensive, but not pedantic.
* Feedback that instructors should provide to allow students to track their own progress as they work to master the class objectives. 

Be sure to include a transition to the next activity

### 6. Recap (5 min)
At the end of the class, take five minutes to review the following:
* What should students absolutely know at the end of this module
* What material is okay if they don’t completely understand?
* Why it’s important to do as much of the async material as possible (hold students accountable for offline work)
* Once again, where in the asynchronous content should students look to learn more or revisit concepts from this Live Class that they don’t fully understand


### 7. Promote Additional Resources (5 min)
Use this time to tell instructors to remind students about additional resources that are available to them- Reference pages, Career Services content, Reflection + Retrieval, and other exciting extensions and opportunities to use this content in a novel way.

### 8. Transition to Challenge Study Hall/Office Hours (1 min)
In our current model, students will be invited to an ‘office hours’ session of 30 minutes directly after class, in which TAs and instructors will be live online and available for support. We recommend that instructors ask students to stay on the Zoom and ‘start the challenge’ during this time for 30-60 minutes, while they have live support.
