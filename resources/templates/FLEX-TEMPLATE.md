# Module X Flex Session: [Title]

## Overview 

Flex Sessions are two hour Zoom sessions held earlier in the week (Mondays/Tuesdays) and are optional for students. Students are expected to be in the middle of working on their asynchronous content during this time of the week. 

The primary goals of Flex Sessions are to:

* Build community and help students feel more connected to instructors and one another

* Help students who are ‚Äústuck‚Äù on the asynchronous work and would appreciate extra guidance and support

* Provide extra context in the learning journey around career preparation and workforce readiness

@TODO In today's flex session, { ... } outline the career topic and the 2-3 key topic areas that will be drawn from the asynchronous content and reinforced in this lesson. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain...

* Use...

* Implement...


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* @TODO heads up?

* @TODO pain points?

* @TODO resources?

* @TODO reference to async

## Class Instruction 

### 1. Introduction/Take Pulse (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of the sesion.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO Do we use the `point up` emoji to signify a 'question'?

    * üôã @TODO Yes. And we use the `raising hand` emoji to signfiy an 'answer'

Here are some ideas for helping instructors gauge how students are feeling:
* "Fist" to "Five": Ask students to rate how comfortable they feel on a topic from "Fist" to "Five". A Fist (0) means they are not feeling comfortable at all. An open hand (5) means that they feel very confident in their mastery of the subject.

* Cold Calling: Remind instructors that they can cold call students in a friendly way to gauge how they are feeling at this point in the week. This helps instructors assess how much one particular student knows, while reinforcing everyone else's knowledge through repetition. Just remember to keep it a safe space and be encouraging.



A 120 minute lesson plan (minus 5 minutes for the intro and 35 minutes for recap and office hours/study hall) will have 80 minutes of instruction. 

For those 80 minutes, the Flex Session will contain one ‚ÄúCareer Focus‚Äù Activity Arc (20-30 minutes) and then 2-3 ‚ÄúConcept Review‚Äù Activities (20-30 minutes each) to convey the relevant concepts from the first half of the asynchronous content. 

Using the 3-part arcs below, a standard arc would be 5-10 minutes of Instructor Do, 10-15 minutes of Student Do, and 5 minutes of Instructor Review. 


One or two activities designed to ensure that the most common early misconceptions in the asynchronous content are not stopping students from progressing. These should ideally be chosen from the first half of the async content, as Flex Sessions happen quite early in the week. 


### 2. Activity Arc 1: Career Tie-In/Industry Focus (20-30 min)

This first activity should be designed to allow students to prepare for their entrance into or  acceleration within the profession. Ideally, this activity is designed in a way that both adds clear value and is interesting enough to be ‚Äòadvertised‚Äô to students in advance. 

The most common activity for this section should be completing one or more algorithmic  practice problems resembling a technical interview question. The purpose of these exercises would be to expose students to the idea of being presented a problem to resolve in a short amount of time, as well as get them comfortable with white-boarding solutions and talking through their thought processes.

Other career tie-in/industry focus activities may include:
* Describe/teach back previously learned material and its relevance to jobs
* Fun ways to look at material (e.g., Looking at weird depictions of coding in movies)
* Memory Tips: Students share the ways they remember syntax? 
* Good coding memes you‚Äôve uncovered during self-study
* Instructors walking through their personal journeys in the professional field
* Deconstructing and demystifying a job description
* Reviewing and comparing the most common coding languages and tools
* Helping build the ‚Äòmindset‚Äô of a developer by asking the instructor modeling how professionals approach problems
* Examining the different routes by which new developers get their first job
* Activities about how to showcase a developer Github or portfolio
* Activities deconstructing a strong and relevant README
* Share different open-source projects or side projects students can take up after the course. 

Use the following Instructor Do/Student Do/Instructor Review Arc to structure this activity.

### 3. Activity Arcs 2, 3 and 4 (time permitting): 

The preceding activities should be selected or created to highlight core concepts from the first half of the asynchronous content. They may be drawn or adapted from existing on-ground lesson plans. 

Use the following Instructor Do/Student Do/Instructor Review Arc to structure this activity.

### 3. Instructor Do: [Activity Title] (5 or 10 min) 
The title of this activity should be simple and correspond as closely as possible to how this same concept is covered elsewhere in the course:  for example, in the asynchronous project and in the Zoom poll used up front. 

The online Instructor Do‚Äôs should ask instructors to teach key concepts from the first half of this week‚Äôs asynchronous content. 

Every Instructor Do should include the following three critical aspects in addition to the actual content that will be delivered:
Goal or objective for this Instructor Do. 
Ensure that the Instructor Do explicitly clarifies exactly which topic of the asynchronous content is being highlighted, and why this topic is worthy of deeper review.
Finally, be sure to include a clear transition to the student activity. 

Visuals: Insert code blocks & screenshots as needed throughout lesson plans. 

Tip: Use ‚ÄúTip:‚Äù to callout special advice for the Instructor or TA.
    Student Do: [Title of Activity] (10 or 15 min) 
Online Student Do‚Äôs ask students to complete a live activity while in the online class and share their results. We strongly encourage you to use the Zoom Breakout Room functionality to create pair or small group activities for at least one activity per class (students have already spent a lot of time working alone). Group activities are particularly useful to meet instructional objectives that require students to work collaboratively.

Because of the shortened time period for online live classes, try to keep set-up time, activities or additional files as simple as possible to maximize time for work. 
	
Every Student Do should include the following four elements:

Overview of the activity for the instructors.
Link to student-facing instructions (e.g., Instructions: README.md). These can be sent to students via chat or Slack during the class.
Directions for the instructor and TA, including what the instructors and TAs should be doing during the activity. 

Examples: instructors and TAs should visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.
Links to relevant files the students will need (e.g., File: Starter Code).
Hint: Use ‚ÄúHint:‚Äù to tell instructors how to call out more information (or steps) to help struggling students complete an activity. 
Instructor Review: [Activity Name] (5 or 10 min) 
Instructor Reviews should bring the class back together if they were broken into Breakout rooms, and then review in one of the following ways: ask for volunteers to provide their results, have the instructor walk through the solution, ask students to lead reviews for other student work, provide prompts to ensure that students truly understood the underlying concepts. 

Instructor Reviews should contain:

Instructor commentary, facilitation questions and talking points.
Solutions and explanations to the activity that are comprehensive, but not pedantic.
Feedback that instructors should provide to allow students to track their own progress as they work to master the class objectives. 
Be sure to include a transition to the next activity

### 6. Recap (5 min)
At the end of the class, take five minutes to review the following:
Which topics were covered today and main student takeaways
What‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt completely understand right now
What areas you should feel comfortable/confident in. 
Why it‚Äôs important to do as much of the async material as possible (hold students accountable for offline work)
Once again, where in the asynchronous content students should look to learn more 
What‚Äôs exciting about the second half of the asynch project. 


### 7. Transition to Office Hours/Study Hall (1 min)

* Announce 'office hours' and invite students to stay on the Zoom and ‚Äòstart the challenge‚Äô while they have live support from instructional staff. 


### 8. Challenge Office Hours/Study Hall (30 min)
