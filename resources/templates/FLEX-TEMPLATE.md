# Module X Flex Session: [Title]

## Overview 

Flex Sessions are two hour Zoom sessions held earlier in the week (Mondays/Tuesdays) and are optional for students. Students are expected to be in the middle of working on their asynchronous content during this time of the week. 

The primary goals of Flex Sessions are to:

* Build community and help students feel more connected to instructors and one another

* Help students who are ‚Äústuck‚Äù on the asynchronous work and would appreciate extra guidance and support

* Provide extra context in the learning journey around career preparation and workforce readiness

@TODO In today's flex session, { ... } outline the career topic and the 2-3 key topic areas that will be drawn from the asynchronous content and reinforced in this lesson. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain...

* Use...

* Implement...


## Preparing For Class/Instructor Notes

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution, line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

* During activities, visit a few breakout rooms quietly and ask the group if they are comfortable with the activity and provide gentle tips to keep them on track.

* @TODO heads up?

* @TODO pain points?

* @TODO resources?

* @TODO reference to async

## Class Instruction 

### 1. Introduction/Take Pulse (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Direct students to post individual questions in the Zoom chat to be addressed by TAs and/or at the end of class.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How are you feeling about your progress so far?

    * üôã @TODO .

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this topic? 

    * üôã Let's do "Fist to Five" together. If you are not feeling confident, hold up a fist (0). If you feel very confident, hold up an open hand (5).



A 120 minute lesson plan (minus 5 minutes for the intro and 35 minutes for recap and office hours/study hall) will have 80 minutes of instruction. 

For those 80 minutes, the Flex Session will contain one ‚ÄúCareer Focus‚Äù Activity Arc (20-30 minutes) and then 2-3 ‚ÄúConcept Review‚Äù Activities (20-30 minutes each) to convey the relevant concepts from the first half of the asynchronous content. 

Using the 3-part arcs below, a standard arc would be 5-10 minutes of Instructor Do, 10-15 minutes of Student Do, and 5 minutes of Instructor Review. 


One or two activities designed to ensure that the most common early misconceptions in the asynchronous content are not stopping students from progressing. These should ideally be chosen from the first half of the async content, as Flex Sessions happen quite early in the week. 


### 2. Activity Arc 1: Career Tie-In/Industry Focus (20-30 min)

This first activity should be designed to allow students to prepare for their entrance into or acceleration within the profession. Ideally, this activity is designed in a way that both adds clear value and is interesting enough to be ‚Äòadvertised‚Äô to students in advance. 

The most common activity for this section should be completing one or more algorithmic  practice problems resembling a technical interview question. The purpose of these exercises would be to expose students to the idea of being presented a problem to resolve in a short amount of time, as well as get them comfortable with white-boarding solutions and talking through their thought processes.

Other career tie-in/industry focus activities may include:
* Deconstructing and demystifying a job description

* Reviewing and comparing the most common coding languages and tools

* Helping build the ‚Äòmindset‚Äô of a developer by asking the instructor modeling how professionals approach problems

* Examining the different routes by which new developers get their first job

* Activities about how to showcase a developer Github or portfolio

* Activities deconstructing a strong and relevant README

* Share different open-source projects or side projects students can take up after the course. 


The following activities should be selected or created to highlight core concepts from the first half of the asynchronous content. They may be drawn or adapted from existing on-ground lesson plans. 

### 3. Instructor Demo: [Activity Title] (5 or 10 min) 

### 4. Student Do: [Title of Activity] (10 or 15 min) 


### 5. Instructor Review: [Activity Name] (5 or 10 min) 



### XX. Recap (5 min)

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What topics did we cover today? What are the main takeaways?

    * üôã @TODO 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think is okay to not completely understand?

    * üôã All of it! The field of web development is very wide and rapidly evolving. Unless you choose to specialize, it's unnecessary to know anything completely to be successful. 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to do as much of the lesson material as possible?

    * üôã It's important to do as much of the lesson material prior to class to not only be fully prepared to start the challenge, but your career as a web developer. We cover a lot of material in our bootcamp. Lessons are designed to give each topic a unique and optimal amount of depth so we can provide the scope needed to confidently build upon, while ensuring time for other important material.

### XX. Transition to Office Hours/Study Hall (1 min)

* Announce 'office hours' and invite students to stay on the Zoom and ‚Äòstart the challenge‚Äô while they have live support from instructional staff. 


### XX. Challenge Office Hours/Study Hall (30 min)
