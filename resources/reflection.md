# Reflection & Retrieval

As you finish up this module, take time to reflect. Even though this might not seem as productive as coding an extra feature, reflecting on what you recently learned is a proven strategy for cementing new knowledge into memory.

## Reflection

Reply to the following prompts to start a conversation with an instructional staff member:

* In your own words, describe the key ideas from this module.

* Give an example of how each key idea is applied.

* How do these key ideas relate to each other?

* How do these key ideas relate to what you learned earlier in the course?

* What are you still curious about?
