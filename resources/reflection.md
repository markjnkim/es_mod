# Reflection & Retrieval

## Reflection

Reflecting on what you recently learned is a proven strategy for cementing new knowledge into memory.

Reply to the following prompts to start a conversation with an instructional staff member:

* In your own words, describe the key ideas from this module.

* Give an example of how each key idea is applied.

* How do these key ideas relate to each other?

* How do these key ideas relate to what you learned earlier in the course?

* What are you still curious about?
