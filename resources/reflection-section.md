# Reflection & Retrieval

Reflecting on what you recently learned is a proven strategy for cementing new knowledge into memory.

## Reflection

Reply to the following prompts to start a conversation with an instructional staff member:

* What went well?

* How did I move through roadblocks or setbacks?

* What could have gone better?

* Where were my roadblocks? 

* What strategies could I use next time to get better results?

* Where do I need to strengthen my understanding?

* How might I go about this?
