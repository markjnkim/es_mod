## Installing Your Tools

Before we begin, you’ll need to make sure you have the following tools installed. If you’ve completed your pre-work, all of these tools should be installed. Each of these get updates frequently, however, so make sure you’ve got the most recent version by clicking on the links below.

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

    * Google Chrome is the primary web browser you will use to test and debug your project as you create it.

* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools): [How to use Chrome DevTools](../01-html/content/lesson-3-hero#introducing-chrome's-devtools)

    * Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. These tools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and debug problems quickly.

* The Command Line: [Getting started with he command line](../01-html/content/lesson-1-html-cmd-git#get-started-with-the-command-line)

    * The command line allows you to set up your projects and interact with your computer without using a graphical interface.

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    * VisualStudio (VS) Code is a free text editor that runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

* Git: [Get Git](../01-html/content/lesson-1-html-cmd-git#get-git)

    * Git is a system that allows you to create "save points" (or **commits**) of your work. It's good practice to commit your work whenever you reach a good stopping point. This creates a history of changes and allows you to revert to an earlier version if necessary.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): [Publish with GitHub](../01-html/content/lesson-1-html-cmd-git#publish-with-github)

    * GitHub is a free website that hosts Git repositories. It also allows developers to code collaboratively and manages version control.

    * GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.
