# Lesson 2: Working With Forms

## Introduction

> **Asset Needed:** Image or gif of application in current state

Taskinator is really starting to take shape! We not only have our HTML in place, but we also have added the ability to interact with the HTML elements to create new tasks for our task list. 

While this is a great start, our ability to add new tasks to a task list isn't fully realized just yet. What good is a task list that keeps adding the same preset task content?

In this lesson, we'll be adding functionality to our application that will allow us to create our own custom tasks by filling out an HTML form.

Let's take a look at the GitHub issue we created to review what we'll work on next:

The last lesson was about using browser events to dynamically create new HTML content and append it to the page. We'll be adding to that in this lesson by adding the ability to read data entered into HTML form elements and using that data to create new tasks. By the end of this lesson, we'll have our MVP for this application!

## Preview 

By the end of this lesson, our application will allow users to fill out a form and create a new task based on the form's input content.

Just like the last lesson, our path to matching the image above will involve the following features:

- A new task can be created by filling out the form with a task name and picking what type of task it is.

- The user can submit as task by either pressing the "Add Task" button or pressing the `Enter` key on a keyboard.

- If one of the form fields is left empty, the task will not be created.

As far as features go, there isn't a terrible amount to add here, but the features getting added to the application are features seen and used throughout modern web development.

Like the last lesson, adding features are done most efficiently when tackled in a certain order, so let's use pseudocode to help outline the steps we will take:

> - Create a New Git branch
> - Add Task Form to HTML
> - Handle Form Submission
> - Capture Form Inputs
> - Create New Task and Organize Functionality
> - Address Usability Concerns
> - Merge branch into develop

Don't be concerned if the order tripped you up a bit, it gets easier with time and experience. A main reason of using pseudocode is to get a loose plan in place for us to follow, even if that plan needs to be changed or corrected later on. We now have an idea of what each step will entail at a high level, even if we don't know all of the details just yet.

Let's start with the usual and create our new Git feature branch!

## Create a New Git Branch

This is a good time for us to review our GitHub issue pertaining to this feature one more time, then let's create our feature branch.

Since the issue is all about submitting form data, let's call the feature branch `feature/form-submit`. We'll create it now from the command line:

- Use `git branch` to ensure we are currently in the `develop` branch, as we want to use that branch's code to build upon.

- Create a new branch for this feature:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/form-submit
```

As we know, this has created the branch and moved us into it, but we can use `git branch` one more time just to double check.

Now that we've confirmed we're in the correct branch, let's get started!

## Add Task Form to HTML




## Handle Form Submission




## Capture Form Inputs

*2–3 sentences describing what will be covered in this section.*

*Walk student through this step, include LBs as appropriate, etc.*

*Transitional text to next section.*

## Create New Task and Organize Functionality



## Reflection

*Congratulate the learner. Recap what they accomplished during the lesson from a broad perspective in a couple of sentences.*

*In this lesson, you added the following skills to your tool belt, knowledge base, skillset:*

- *Skill learned in 1-2 sentences*

- *Skill learned in 1-2 sentences*

- *Skill learned in 1-2 sentences*

- *Etc.*

*If this is the last lesson in a module, recap the entire module and introduce the next module.*

*If this is not the last lesson in a module, introduce the next lesson and how it will build on the skills in this lesson.*
